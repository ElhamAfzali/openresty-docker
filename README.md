## Overview

This repository provides a Dockerfile and scripts to build and push a custom OpenResty Docker image with various OpenResty modules enabled for flexibility and customization.

## Requirements

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- A [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) account
- [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) with Docker support

## Setup in PyCharm

To work with this project in PyCharm:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/openresty_docker.git
    ```

2. Open the project in PyCharm by selecting `File -> Open` and navigating to the cloned repository folder.

3. Ensure Docker is configured in PyCharm:
   - Go to `File -> Settings -> Build, Execution, Deployment -> Docker`.
   - Add a new Docker configuration using the "+" button, and ensure it points to the correct Docker instance (e.g., Docker Desktop or system Docker).

4. Add a Docker interpreter in PyCharm (optional):
   - Go to `File -> Settings -> Project: <Your Project Name> -> Python Interpreter`.
   - Click the settings icon, then select `Add...`, and choose `Docker`.
   - In the `Docker` tab, configure the image and interpreter as needed.

5. To run the provided bash scripts (`build.sh` and `push.sh`):
   - Open the `Terminal` in PyCharm (`View -> Tool Windows -> Terminal`).
   - Run the build and push commands from the terminal.
